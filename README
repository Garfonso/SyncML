SyncML on webOs 2.x

This is an implementation of a SyncML client in JavaScript together with an iCal parser to allow webOs to sync a calendar with a SyncML server. Currently this is tested with some SyncML servers, including syncevolution, libsynthesis based stuff, horde/eGroupware, funambol/myFunambol/oneMediahub, Syncfriend.com. Reported to be basically working are O3SIS Server (used by O2 Germany) and Oracle OCS. 

This is also released into the webos-nation feeds and can be installed OTA with Preware. A submission into the app catalog is unlikely at the current time. Maybe in a distant future that might be possibel.

Be sure to have a decent backup for your data! I am not responsible for any data loss or messup of data! The data on your phone "should" be save, a new calendar & addressbook is created, everything else can not be touched by this app. The data on the server can be messed up, if there are misunderstanding between the app and the server. Especially timezone issues might arise. If that happens, please report back!
After the first sync, that puts everything from the server into the device, be sure to check the presentation of the data on the device. If something is awkward, better *NOT* sync back, but report back with a log. 

The sync of contacts is to be added later. Maybe also more datastore types (I'd like notes or todos). You could theoretically use SyncML to sync any type of data, also possibly just in one direction. This could be used for a synergy integrated multimedia sync.

The synergy integration is quite done. The JavaScript SyncML Client and iCal parser work. 

My list of Todo's
- Complete synergy integration (only create is an issue now)
- Implement contacts sync (will require new or extended parser or use webOS integrated stuff)
- Optimize old eventCallback structure to be more database optimized and collect all adds, updates and deletes to do them in one batch.

Pull requests are welcome! :)

State of the software:
Known Issues:
- x-vcalendar implementation does not yet support b64ecoding/decoding.
- O3SIS Server (like O2 Germany operates for its customers) does not understand our device info and therefore will not send more complicated recurring events to me.
- Can't interpret "DAYLIGHT" string, yet. Need to extract TZID from that.
- Still some errors won't return from service to caller...
- 500 internal server error for onemediahub.com during check credentials. Hm. How to resolve that? 
- No VTIMEZONE entries are generated for events that set a TZID param in DTSTART/DTEND.

Changelog:
2012-05-31 => 0.1.13
- reverted the UTC behaviour. Now sending TZID=... parameter. Issue: ical rfc requests VTIMEZONE for that also. I'm not sure if we can create that one... issue with UTC is allday events. Always the same trouble. :(
2012-05-31 => 0.1.12
- fixed tz issue, now transfering everything as UTC.
- changed behaviour of old log files to not truncate but move them.
2012-05-28 => 0.1.11
- fixed reset service
- added some hacks to support Syncfriend.com
- added some fixes to support alarm parsing from OCS server.
2012-05-27 => 0.1.10
- fixed possible failure if put device info is not supported.
- set delete event not to purge db to prevent alarms from sticking.
- cleaned up MimeTypes in device info (thanks to Matthias)
2012-05-26 => 0.1.9
- fixed issues with account creation and deletion on webOS 2.1.1.
- hotifx: fixed issue with account management if no account was present, yet.
- hotfix: fixed issue with keymanager if no key was present, yet.
2012-05-26 => 0.1.8
- hopefully solved deadlock during account creation.
- locks for the service calls are now much less restrictive
- app can even reattach to a running sync. :)
- solved issue where all controls in configScene would be disabled if service was still running after create account from account app.
- solved another issue with syncEvolution
- improved account deletion, possible associated webOS accounts will be deleted again.
2012-05-23 => 0.1.7
- changed behaviour to not send last anchor, if not present.
- fixed account creation / modification / deletion from app.
2012-05-22 => 0.1.4
- implemented "local" fix of AjaxCall to work with non standard http ports.
- added "Delete this account" - Button to config scene to delete accounts. Deletes accounts only from the apps db. If there exists a webOS account, delete it from the accounts app (should also delete app's account object).
- tried to add some more error messages to log files.
- fixed issue with attached E-Mail log (thanks to Matthias)
2012-05-21 => 0.1.3
- fixed possible issue during parsing of device data from server
- fixed locking up of modifyAccount calls during storeAccount. Race condition with onCredentialsChanged call. We don't really use onCredentialsChanged, anyway.
- fixed issues were the app lost connection to the service and would hang forever in the sync scene. (Now this only happens if the service itself crashes)
- fixed account icons 
2012-05-20 => 0.1.2
- Ignoring 406 errors = optional feature not supported. Maybe that helps with oracle server.
- Added menu entry to reset the service. Only use this if you are sure that the service hangs and you don't want for it to timeout ( one minute without action ). 
2012-05-20 => 0.1.1
- added repairDBPermission.sh script into app folder to repair db permissions. Issues might arise, if the app was installed before submitted to webos nation. Careful: Script might delete all data.
2012-05-20 => 0.1.0
- Major change: Implemented node.js service. 
- App only calls service functions
- Cleaned up log in the app itself considerably!
- Writing exhaustive log to /media/internal/.info.mobo.syncml.log (accessible in usb-mode)
- Not logging passwords (hopefully)
- Passwords and usernames stored only encrypted
- Integration into account app, delete and disable / enable of calendar/contacts works
- Create from account manager works partially (need to find out how to prevent it from spawning the welcome scene and popping it to front)
- E-Mail log improved, adds log-file as attachment
- log is truncated at 2MB, that means many sync processes can be kept in log and logs can be send way after the sync process that failed.
2012-05-17 => 0.0.16
- added a status description above log output. Should help with outside errors, like wrong credentials or connection aborts.
- changed behavior, app won't suggest slow sync (happened too often). On broken sync the server should request a slow sync anyway.
2012-05-14
- fixed some issues with account creation. Should now work again.
- now 0.0.15 is sending capability description to the server. This might help in some cases where synchronization is not working. Hopefully this does not break anything.
- app now is using the full screen on a Pre3. 
2012-05-01
- fixed a bug that prevented events with recurrence on a first Sunday of a month to be handled correctly.
- fixed a bug that prevented aalarms to be interpreted correctly. 
2012-04-25
- fixed bug that prevent any action if no account was specified.
2012-04-24
- improved the app to force initialization to happen before sync can be started. As a side effect sync is now started automatically in the sync scene.
- changed the app icon.
2012-04-22
- service can now load the complete syncml library. Great step towards real synergy integration and background sync.
2012-04-20
- app now selects first account automatically
2012-02-07
- fixed a bug that changed the msgId for repeated msg tries.
- repaired service configuration, service can now be started, but does not have functionalities.
2012-02-02
- fixed a bug that sended deletes to the server until a change (other than a delete) on the client device happened.
- fixed a bug with restored profiles that prevented changes from the device to be send to the server during a fast sync
2012-01-29
- fixed bug that prevented iCal->webOs time conversion to fail for UTC times denoted by a "Z" in the time string and no TZID field.
- first steps in implementing the service, but is still crashing during startup.
2012-01-21
- implemented x-vcalendar support for recurring events. Now older server should work properly.
2012-01-19
- implemented x-vcalendar support for servers like O2. Missing: Support for recurring events. 
- implemented quoted_printable and utf-8 support for x-vcalendar
- fixed a bug that prevented events without timezone information from completing iCal => webOs conversion.
- fixed a bug that prevented incoming, not repeating events, to show up in the device calendar
2012-01-18
- Supplied most funcitions with try/catch blocks to make system more robust and ease debugging
- implemented retry mechanism if empty response is received (how to systematically test that??)
- fixed a bug that prevented server updates from deleting fields in webOs.
- fixed some bugs that prevented updates from client to server.
- O2 currently really broken. Need to add support for x-vcalendar = iCal 1.0. :(
2012-01-17
- Added abilty to repair missformated XML if &,< or > characters are in unencoded item data.
- Fixed timezone issue. Now using Timezone Manager from frameworks/calendar. Might be forbidden for app catalog. But precentral is also fine for distribution...
2012-01-12
- Tried to fix some issues I had with O3SIS SyncML Server (used by O2 Germany):
  - allDay issue fixed. 
  - Alarm partly fixed (sometimes alarm does not appear on server, need to investigate further).
  - Detected new character encoding problem.
  - Still the server does not accept my device info, don't know why.
older:
- Modified app to allow to send logs per E-Mail
